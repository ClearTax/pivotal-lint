## Features

1. **Validates branches that are filed as PRs**. It uses the pivotal API to provide GitHub status checks that help you avoid merging PRs without valid story IDs.
1. **Adds a summary of the story details** to the beginning of the PR's description for better documentation & linking from GitHub ‚Üí Pivotal. ![pr-lint](https://assets1.cleartax-cdn.com/cleargst-frontend/misc/1568800226_pr-lint.png)
1. Automatically labels PRs based on:
    1. Team name label based on the pivotal board name. if your pivotal board name is `Escher POD` then it will add `escher` as a label. Pivotal board name is fetched from the given story id.
    1. `HOTFIX-PROD` - if the PR is raised against `production-release`
    1. `HOTFIX-PRE-PROD` - if the PR is raised against `release/v*`

## Usage

To make pr-lint a part of your workflow, just add a `pr-lint.yml` file in your `.github/workflows/` directory in your git repo.

```yaml
name: PR lint
 on: [pull_request]
 jobs:
  pr_lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Verify Pivotal story ID & add relevant labels
      uses: cleartax/pr-lint@master
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        pivotal-token: ${{ secrets.PIVOTAL_TOKEN }}
        skip-branches: '^(production-release|master|release\/v\d+)$'
```
