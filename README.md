## Features

1. **Validates branches that are filed as PRs**. It uses the pivotal API to provide GitHub status checks that help you avoid merging PRs without valid story IDs.
1. **Adds a summary of the story details** to the beginning of the PR's description for better documentation & linking from GitHub ‚Üí Pivotal. ![pr-lint](https://assets1.cleartax-cdn.com/cleargst-frontend/misc/1568800226_pr-lint.png)
1. Automatically labels PRs based on:
    1. Team name label based on the pivotal board name. if your pivotal board name is `Escher POD` then it will add `escher` as a label. Pivotal board name is fetched from the given story id.
    1. `HOTFIX-PROD` - if the PR is raised against `production-release`
    1. `HOTFIX-PRE-PROD` - if the PR is raised against `release/v*`

## Usage

To make pr-lint a part of your workflow, just add a `pr-lint.yml` file in your `.github/workflows/` directory in your git repo.

```yaml
name: PR lint
 on: [pull_request]
 jobs:
  pr_lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Verify Pivotal story ID & add relevant labels
      uses: cleartax/pr-lint@master
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        pivotal-token: ${{ secrets.PIVOTAL_TOKEN }}
        skip-branches: '^(production-release|master|release\/v\d+)$'
```

### Options

|key|description|required|
|---|---|---|
|`github-token`| Token used to update PR description. Must have write access to your repository.|true|
|`pivotal-token`|API Token used to fetch Pivotal Story information. Must have read access to your Pivotal boards.|true|
|`skip-branches`|A regex to ignore running PR lint on certain branches, like production etc.|false

Since tokens are private, we suggest adding them as [GitHub secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables).

### Skipping branches

Since GitHub actions take string inputs, you must generate a regex which will work for all sets of branches you want to ignore. This is useful for merging protected/default branches into other branches. Check out some [examples in the tests](https://github.com/ClearTax/pr-lint/blob/2bb72327ef04ab028caf84a099ffbc08b4dd0959/__tests__/utils.test.ts#L30-L41).

`pr-lint` already skips PRs which are filed by bots (eg dependabot). You can add more bots to [this list](https://github.com/ClearTax/pr-lint/blob/2bb72327ef04ab028caf84a099ffbc08b4dd0959/src/constants.ts#L4-L6).

### Versions

If you want more stability in versions than `@master` you can also use the [semantic releases for pr-lint](https://github.com/ClearTax/pr-lint/releases).

Example:

```yaml
# ...
  pr_lint:
    steps:
    - name: Verify Pivotal story ID & add relevant labels
      uses: cleartax/pr-lint@v2.1.0
      # ...
```
